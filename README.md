SampSharp (S# for short) is a plugin and library that allows you to write San Andreas: Multiplayer(SA-MP) gamemodes in C# or any other .NET language. S#'s aim is to allow you to enjoy all features of OO-programming and .NET. S# uses the .Net Core to allow linux servers to run this plugin as well. For information about installing and building S#, check the documentation. If you have any questions, join our [Slack] chat, file an issue or post on our SA-MP forum post.
